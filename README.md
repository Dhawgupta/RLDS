# Reinforcement Learning Dialouge System
The name and folder are as : 
1. DDQN - Double DQN
2. PER - Priority Experience Replay
3. SVM - with SVM 
4. woSVM - without SVM

So ,
```DDQN-PERwoSVM``` : is Double DQN Priority Experience Replay without SVM     
```NLU_Deep``` : contains the integration of real NLU with the Deep RL Model
```NLU_Table``` : contains the integration of the NLU with the traditional Q_table method

To run individual model its **README** is present in its respective folder.
The folder SVM contains the code to run the SVM model with its dummy .This  model gives recommendation to the DRL method
